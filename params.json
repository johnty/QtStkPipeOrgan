An introduction and background on the physical layout and relevant parts of a pipe organ \r\n\t2. A discussion on how various parts of the organ may be modelled\r\n\t3. Implementation details of the C++ application so far\r\n\r\n![Ryerson Organ](img/ryerson.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe organ at Ryerson United Church, Vancouver BC\r\n\r\n---\r\n##Background\r\n\r\n* Despite having a chromatic keyboard, the organ is very different to most keyboard instruments\r\n\r\n* The pipe organ is a wind instrument, as opposed to string/percussion instruments that most other are. (One other exception is the accordion!)\r\n\r\n* Unlike other wind instruments, the air is not supplied by the player directly. Traditionally created using manual bellows; nowadays digital blowers\r\n![organ bellows](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/HalberstadtBurchardiChurchBellows.jpg)\r\n(img src: wikipedia)\r\n\r\n* Air is fed into banks of pipes that produce sound\r\n\r\n* A large church organ can have thousands of pipes\r\n\r\n###Flue and Reed Pipes\r\n\r\nThere are two main kinds of pipes on an organ.\r\n\r\n* The flue pipe is somewhat similar in operation to a flute (or perhaps more appropriately, a recorder)\r\n\r\n![flue pipes](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/PSM_V40_D651_Flue_stop_organ_pipes.jpg)\r\n(img src: wikipedia/Clarke)\r\n\r\n* The reed pipe is more like a clarinet:\r\n* The pipes are grouped together in a row (called \"stops\" or \"ranks\")\r\n\r\n![wind chest](img/windchests.png)\r\n![cross sectional](img/windchests2.png)\r\n(img src: Clarke 1877)\r\n\r\n###Adjusting the Sound\r\n\r\n* Control of individual pipe by adjusting its physical parameters (Voicing)\r\n* Choosing combinations of stops to be used\r\n\r\n* \r\n\r\n###Air Source\r\n\r\nThe rows of organ\r\n\r\n###Combinations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Control System/Inputs\r\n\r\nKeyboard: 6 octaves of chromatic notes,. Set of 3-6 depending on instrument. Referred to as manuals.\r\n\r\nPedalboard: 1 ~ 3 octaves of chromatic notes, activated by foot\r\n\r\nStops: pull controls \r\n\r\nFoot switches: discrete buttons for activating settings, swell shutters that control\r\n\r\nTraditionally, everything is linked mechanically (Tracker organs).\r\n\r\n![Tracker Organ](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Pipe_organ_tracker_action.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\nMost modern organs are digitally controlled. Electronic \r\n\r\n####*The Organ is probably the world's first \"synthesizer\"*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the more obvious differences include the sound generation mechanism: the pipe organ functions more like a wind instrument (both reeded and open hole) rather than a string struck by a percussive hammer. \r\n\r\nSecond, with exception to the swell box shutters that control the amount of sound that exits the enclosure housing the pipes, the volume produced by the instrument is mostly controlled by the number of active \"stops\", or groups called \"registers\" that are activated at the same time. This means that the amount of volume, and tone output is defined by the currently selected mixture of stops, rather than the velocity in which the key is played.\r\n\r\n## Commercial Products\r\n\r\nOne of the more famous virtual software organ systems is [Hauptwerk](https://www.hauptwerk.com/learn-more/overview/). It has an extensive sample-based library of many organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Implementation\r\n\r\nMost of the development was performed on a Windows laptop with 8GB RAM and an Intel i7-4510u processor. The reason Windows was chosen was, based on prior experience, integrating such cross platform libraries tend to be the most difficult on this operating system, and hence having figured out how to set it up for this case, the rest should be considerably easier.\r\n\r\n![test ](img/system.png)\r\n\r\n###Instrument Models\r\n\r\nAs described in the previous section, there are two main categories of organ pipes: the flue and the reed.\r\n\r\n![test ](img/keyboard-flutes.png)\r\n\r\n##Framework Overview\r\nQT is ... Stk/RtAudio\r\n\r\n##Library Integration\r\n\r\nchallenges (esp. windows)\r\n\r\n##Realtime Audio Implementation\r\n\r\nVirtual MIDI Control\r\n\r\n###Performance Metrics\r\nVery early in the implementation, as soon as the real time dac was integrated, I wanted to make sure there was enough processing power to handle a large number of voices. As a very crude first test, I attempted to compute a large number of sine waves. The number achieved without noticeable dropouts in the audio stream was somewhere between 512 and 800 simultaneous Stk Sine objects that were computed sample by sample (using a single .tick() command for each frame. As a comparison, the same code, when running on a desktop-class i5 system, ran without dropouts at around 900 objects. Of course, this is not a rigorous test by any means, but should provide a general ballpark figure.\r\n\r\n###Discussion and Conclusion\r\n\r\nloren ipsum\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
